one of that group of cool, gray-eyed men who roam the spaceways and

<p class="pr1"><big><b>He had been promising himself this moment for how
many lonely months and years on alien worlds?</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">Beneath</span> him the clovered
hill-slope was warm
in the sun. Northwest Smith
moved his shoulders against
the earth and closed his eyes,
breathing so deeply that the
gun holstered upon his chest
drew tight against its strap
as he drank the fragrance of
Earth and clover warm in the
sun. Here in the hollow of
the hills, willow-shaded, pillowed
upon clover and the
lap of Earth, he let his
breath run out in a long sigh
and drew one palm across the
grass in a caress like a
lover's.</p>

<p>He had been promising
himself this moment for how
long&mdash;how many months and
years on alien worlds? He
would not think of it now.
He would not remember the
dark spaceways or the red
slag of Martian drylands or
the pearl-gray days on Venus
when he had dreamed of the
Earth that had outlawed
him. So he lay, with his eyes
closed and the sunlight
drenching him through, no
sound in his ears but the passage
of a breeze through the
grass and a creaking of some
insect nearby&mdash;the violent,
blood-smelling years behind
him might never have been.
Except for the gun pressed
into his ribs between his
chest and the clovered earth,
he might be a boy again,
years upon years ago, long
before he had broken his
first law or killed his first
man.</p>

<p>No one else alive now
knew who that boy had been.
Not even the all knowing Patrol.
Not even Venusian Yarol,
who had been his closest
friend for so many riotous
years. No one would ever
know&mdash;now. Not his name
(which had not always been
Smith) or his native land or
the home that had bred him,
or the first violent deed that
had sent him down the devious
paths which led here&mdash;here
to the clover hollow in
the hills of an Earth that had
forbidden him ever to set
foot again upon her soil.</p>

<p>He unclasped the hands behind
his head and rolled over
to lay a scarred cheek on his
arm, smiling to himself.
Well, here was Earth beneath
him. No longer a green
star high in alien skies, but
warm soil, new clover so
near his face he could see
all the little stems and trefoil
leaves, moist earth granular
at their roots. An ant
ran by with waving antennae
close beside his cheek. He
closed his eyes and drew another
deep breath. Better not
even look; better to lie here
like an animal, absorbing the
sun and the feel of Earth
blindly, wordlessly.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dcap">Now he</span> was not Northwest
Smith, scarred outlaw
of the spaceways. Now he
was a boy again with all his
life before him. There would
be a white-columned house
just over the hill, with
shaded porches and white
curtains blowing in the
breeze and the sound of
sweet, familiar voices indoors.
There would be a girl
with hair like poured honey
hesitating just inside the
door, lifting her eyes to him.
Tears in the eyes. He lay
very still, remembering.</p>

<p>Curious how vividly it all
came back, though the house
had been ashes for nearly
twenty years, and the girl&mdash;the
girl ...</p>

<p>He rolled over violently,
opening his eyes. No use remembering
her. There had
been that fatal flaw in him
from the very first, he knew
now. If he were the boy
again knowing all he knew
today, still the flaw would be
there and sooner or later the
same thing must have happened
that had happened
twenty years ago. He had
been born for a wilder age,
when men took what they
wanted and held what they
could without respect for
law. Obedience was not in
him, and so&mdash;</p>

<p>As vividly as on that day
it happened he felt the same
old surge of anger and despair
twenty years old now,
felt the ray-gun bucking hard
against his unaccustomed
fist, heard the hiss of its
deadly charge ravening into
a face he hated. He could not
be sorry, even now, for that
first man he had killed. But
in the smoke of that killing
had gone up the columned
house and the future he
might have had, the boy himself&mdash;lost
as Atlantis now&mdash;and
the girl with the honey-colored
hair and much, much
else besides. It had to happen,
he knew. He being the
boy he was, it had to happen.
Even if he could go back
and start all over, the tale
would be the same.</p>

<p>And it was all long past
now, anyhow; and nobody remembered
any more at all,
except himself. A man would
be a fool to lie here thinking
about it any longer.</p>

<p>Smith grunted and sat up,
shrugging the gun into place
against his ribs.</p>
